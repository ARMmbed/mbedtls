Changes
   * The symbols MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_VSNPRINTF_ALT and
     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_SNPRINTF_ALT are no longer forced to be defined on
     Windows. The library still uses its (v)snprintf wrappers on older
     Windows runtimes where they are needed, so this only affects applications
     that test MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_{V,}SNPRINTF_ALT in their own code.
