Changes
   * On Linux, use the getrandom() system call if available, even when
     building with a libc that does not define __GLIBC__. This
     requires the libc to provide <sys/syscall.h> and a syscall()
     function. As before, getrandom() is only used if SYS_getrandom is
     defined during the build and there is a runtime fallback to
     /dev/urandom if the getrandom() system call fails.
